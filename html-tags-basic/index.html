        The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PLUS
            a slash (/) preceeding the name
        
        Normally you will specificy the languae of the code on the web page 
        use the lang element parameter to specify your coding language

        <!--this is an element where you can code supports for the
             browser to use in interpreting the web page.

            <h1>Basic HTML Tags</h1>
            <h3>Paragraph tag</h3>
            <!--this is the coding block for your content in a paragraph tag. A paragraph tag belongs
            to the "block" group of tags. The "block" group of tags places your content on a new line-->
            <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line in your displayed web page on the browser.
                The browser does NOT display your content in the physical style of how you have entered your code in your
                html file.
            </p>
            <p>This is my second paragraph on the displayed browser page. It will start a new line.</p>
            

            <!--if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag) you would be in trouble using the tag. 
                Instead: you can use special character strings to represent component of the tag such as the < (&lt;) and 
                the > (&gt;) symbols-->
            <h3>List tags: &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; </h3>
            <!--block tage
                create an ordered list (numbered) using <ol>
                create an unordered list (bulleted) using <ul>
                items in the list are indicated using the <li>-->

            <h3>Anchor tag</h3>
            <!--This is an anchor tage and is incorrectly often referred to as the link tag.
                One should NOT use the term 'link tag' because there is actually a <link> tag used in the
                <head> section. The link tag can take you to a different location whether it be a different
                website, different page in the current web site, or a different position on the current page

                parameters:
                    href: points to the desired location
                    target: indicates the browser page display option
                        default is same display page
                        _blank will open a new browser tab (page)
            --> 
   
            <a href="https://www.nait.ca" target="_blank">go to Nait</a>
